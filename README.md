Restaurant Rater

A Restaurant Rating app that I made in a day. This app uses a noSQL database, MongoDB. The restaurant model can be viewed [here](app/models/restaurant.rb).

This app is a rails app that serves up a RESTful api to a backbone frontend. The backbone view for the restaurant show page, which includes a list of all ratings for the restaurant and an average of the ratings can be seen [here](app/assets/javascripts/views/restaurant_show.js). 

This app is now production ready and can be viewed [here]()
